## Job Application Data Entry
This web application simplifies the process of tracking job applications by providing a user-friendly interface for entering and managing job application data. I like to document my job applications, and after 2 years of manual excel entry, I wanted to optimize my process. I developed this tool to streamline the data entry and tracking process.

- **Backend**: Python with Flask for handling server-side logic.
- **Data Handling**: 
  - **Pandas**: For processing and analyzing job application data, excel.
